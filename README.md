#### A declarative DSL for reading and writing binary file formats

This library implements a small DSL that is used to describe binary file
formats.  It was written to support reading and writing SuperCollider
synthesizer definition files for Project Overtone, but it can be used for many
binary file formats.  

### Project Info:

#### Source Repository
Downloads and the source repository can be found on GitHub:
